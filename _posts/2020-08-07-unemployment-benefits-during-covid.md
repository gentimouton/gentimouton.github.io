Notes from [US Unemployment Insurance Replacement Rates During the Pandemic](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/BFI_WP_202062-1.pdf) 
by Ganon et al.

During COVID, the economy slowed down and unemployment reached record levels.
So Congress passed the CARES Act, to boost unemployment benefits by a flat $600 per week for 13 weeks, called the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC).
Congress came up with this $600 number so as to exactly match the average nation-wide salary when summed with the average unemployment benefits provided by states.
Because it's a flat number and based on an average, it results in 68% of eligible unemployed workers being paid more from unemployment benefits than their past salary.
What are the pros and cons?
How does the situation differ by state and occupation?
What could be an alternative policy?

## Pros and cons

Pros:
- More liquidity to buy more goods.
- Buy health insurance, often lost when unemployed.
- Stay home, and prevent spread of COVID.

Cons:
- Prevent labor reallocation: worker has no incentive to find work in another sector booming during COVID, 
for a pay similar to their old salary (eg food delivery).
- Unfairness: workers in essential sectors make less than laid-off equivalent in non-essential sectors.
For example, a janitor for a hospital vs for a shut-down office building.


## Heterogenity of median replacement rate 

Among the top 10 occupations, the median replacement rate ranges from 65% for IT to 180% for food service.

By state, it ranges from 129% in Maryland to 177% in New Mexico. 
New England is generally lower, and the South generally higher.


## Alternative policy

A fixed number will always overcompensate a proportion of unemployed workers - those who made less than that number. \
For example, a halved FPUC of $300 still leads to 42% of eligible workers making more while unemployed.

Proposal: make FPUC a *proportion* of the worker's past salary, instead of a fixed amount.
The authors simulate various proportions, and find that 45% is the optimal proportion.


| Policy | <80% of past salary | 80-100% | >100% |
|---|---|---|---|
| Flat $600 | 20% | 12% | 68% | 
| Flat $300 | 40% | 18% | 42% |
| 45% of past salary | 25% | 68% | 7% |
